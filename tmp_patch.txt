+"""Apply assessment weights to historical grade entries.
+
+Purpose:
+    Provide helpers for weighting historical assessment entries prior to
+    aggregation further along the preprocessing pipeline.
+Inputs:
+    History entries retrieved from persistent storage via ``io``
+    helpers, structured as mappings containing string keys for
+    ``subject``, ``score``, and ``type``.
+Outputs:
+    Weighted history dictionaries keyed by subject name so that later
+    preprocessing stages can combine and normalise scores consistently.
